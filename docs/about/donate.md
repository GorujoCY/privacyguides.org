Privacy Guides has been a nonstop effort for over 5 years to stay up to date with the world of cybersecurity and privacy, and to promote the benefits of privacy overall. This is a **non-profit, community-driven** project that would not be possible without the generous support of all our [contributors](contributors.md), in addition to our regularly donating members above.

## How We Use Donations

Privacy Guides is a **non-profit** project. Your donation will go to a [dedicated fund](https://magicgrants.org/funds/privacy_guides) within [MAGIC Grants](https://magicgrants.org), a 501(c)(3) organization and our fiscal host. The funds will **only** be used for this project specifically.

You may qualify for a tax deduction. When you donate to us [here](https://donate.magicgrants.org/privacyguides) with cryptocurrency or card you have the option to receive a receipt from MAGIC Grants for this purpose. If you have questions about other transactions please email <info@magicgrants.org>.

We use donations for a variety of purposes, including:

**Web Hosting**

:   Traffic to this website uses hundreds of gigabytes of data per month, we use a variety of service providers to keep up with this traffic.

**Payroll**

:   We are endeavoring to [hire](jobs.md) full-time journalists and writers to review products and create more educational content on a regular basis.

**Domain Registrations**

:   We have a few domain names like `privacyguides.org` which cost us around $10 yearly to maintain their registration.

**Online Services**

:   We host [internet services](services.md) for testing and showcasing different privacy-products we like and [recommend](../tools.md). Some of them are made publicly available for our community's use (SearXNG, Tor, etc.), and some are provided for our team members (email, etc.).

**Product Purchases**

:   We occasionally purchase products and services for the purposes of testing our [recommended tools](../tools.md).

Thank you to all those who support our mission! :material-heart:{ .pg-red }

We strictly **cannot** use donations to support political campaigns/candidates or attempt to influence legislation. Earnings also will **not** inure to the benefit of any private shareholder or individual.

## Merchandise

Another option to support us is by buying our merchandise from HelloTux. We get a small commission for each item sold, and you get a quality product to show for it.

## Non-Financial Support

It takes a lot of [people](contributors.md) and [work](https://github.com/privacyguides/privacyguides.org/pulse/monthly) to keep Privacy Guides up to date and spread the word about privacy and mass surveillance. If you're looking for other ways to help out, consider getting involved by [editing the site](https://github.com/privacyguides/privacyguides.org), [joining our forum](https://discuss.privacyguides.net), or [contributing translations](https://crowdin.com/project/privacyguides).
