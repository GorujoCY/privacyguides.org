Everything within our community must adhere to our conduct policies. This document deals with some trickier moderation decisions you may be wondering about.

## Keep a Light Touch

In many situations, our community can be trusted to self-moderate. If you have been granted moderation privileges, you are empowered to make any moderation decisions you deem necessary.

However, it is better in many situations to enter a conversation and "cool down" the discussion taking place, or steer it towards a more constructive topic.

This is better than ending conversations, deleting posts, or locking threads in many situations. People can feel very passionate about some of the issues we discuss in our community, and this can lead to heated discussions, but in the end many such people only want to be a vocal advocate for their position, and can be guided to do so in a constructive manner.

Of course, conversations that devolve into harassment or other violations of our strict code of conduct should be ended immediately and reported.

## Identifying "Bad Faith" Comments

We should always strive to enter discussions in good faith. Likewise, we expect participants in our communities to engage in good faith as well. When reading comments in our community, comments which meet the following definition of "bad faith" should be removed:

1. The poster fails to provide reasoning for their criticism, and is unwilling to engage in a meaningful discussion.
2. The poster presents their criticism as factual, when it's really a matter of opinion.
3. The poster presents their critisicm as factual, when it's actually false or misinformation.
4. The poster is not looking for anything to be improved, they are simply spreading negativity.
5. The poster is speculating, but presenting their conjectures as informed or factual.
6. The poster engages in ad hominem attacks against us, community members, or other communities.

You should **never** close topics or remove comments simply because you personally disagree with the topic or direction of the conversation.
