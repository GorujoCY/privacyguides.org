## Identifying "Bad Faith" Comments

We should always strive to enter discussions in good faith. Likewise, we expect participants in our communities to engage in good faith as well. When reading comments in our community, comments which meet the following definition of "bad faith" should be removed:

1. The poster fails to provide reasoning for their criticism, and is unwilling to engage in a meaningful discussion.
2. The poster presents their criticism as factual, when it's really a matter of opinion.
3. The poster presents their critisicm as factual, when it's actually false or misinformation.
4. The poster is not looking for anything to be improved, they are simply spreading negativity.
5. The poster is speculating, but presenting their conjectures as informed or factual.
6. The poster engages in ad hominem attacks against us, community members, or other communities.

You should **never** close topics or remove comments simply because you personally disagree with the topic or direction of the conversation.
